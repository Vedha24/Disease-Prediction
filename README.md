# Disease-Prediction
Project Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the presence of a disease based on patient data. The goal is to build a model that achieves high performance, evaluated using the ROC-AUC score. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and prediction generation.

Objectives
Data Preprocessing:

Load the training dataset.
Handle missing values and perform feature engineering and scaling.
Model Training:

Split the training dataset into training and validation subsets.
Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Optimize model hyperparameters for best performance.
Prediction:

Load the test dataset.
Generate predictions and save them in a CSV file named student_<ID>_predictions.csv, where <ID> is your unique student ID. The CSV file should contain columns: patient_id, prediction.
